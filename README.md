# Turn On the Tides (TOTs)

## Introduction

This project focuses on integrating a tidal package into the ECCO v4r5 ocean state estimate. Our goal was to test ECCO’s capabilities by incorporating tidal forcing in this coarse grid model and then analyze the resulting outputs. To achieve this, we used the ecco_v4_py and pyTMD Python packages for data visualization and comparison and for tidal analysis respectively.
Throughout the project, team members gained hands-on experience in working with large-scale oceanographic datasets and scientific software tools. Key skills developed include:
* Working with ECCO v4r5 and modifying model configurations
* Implementing and testing tidal models
* Using Python libraries (ecco_v4_py, pyTMD, NumPy, Matplotlib) for scientific data processing and visualization
* Interpreting geophysical model outputs and conducting investigative analysis
This project provided a practical opportunity to bridge theoretical knowledge in oceanography with real-world data modeling and coding practices.

### The problem

In this project, we explore the technical challenge of integrating a tidal forcing package—originally designed for a high-resolution ocean model—into a coarser-resolution model: ECCO v4r5. ECCO currently lacks tidal components, which limits its ability to simulate certain ocean dynamics accurately.
By adapting and evaluating tidal forcing in ECCO v4r5, we aim to assess whether the inclusion of tides improves or degrades the model's performance. This exploration is important in the broader context of ocean modeling, as more accurate tidal representations can enhance the realism of large-scale simulations used for climate research, sea level studies, and coastal applications. If successful, this work could contribute to improved parameterizations and more reliable ocean state estimates.

## Data and Methods

### Data

The data used in this project is generated by running the ECCO v4r5 ocean model. While the model output files themselves are not included in the project directory due to their large size, the directory contains the full ECCO v4r5 source code along with detailed instructions on how to configure and run the model to produce the necessary outputs.
ECCO v4r5 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Version 4 Release 5) is a global, coarse-resolution ocean state estimate. It produces output data such as sea surface height, ocean velocities, temperature, and salinity fields, typically stored in NetCDF or binary format and compatible with analysis tools like xarray, ecco_v4_py, and pyTMD.
Official ECCO v4r5 data and documentation are available at: https://ecco-group.org/.
